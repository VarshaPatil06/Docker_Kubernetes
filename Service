You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.

steps:
1.Check pods and sevices config using below commands
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc

2.Check if able to access service using below command
curl <cluster IP:8000>
3. Check on browser using <node public IP:nodeport>
4. Ensure that port 8000 is not already in use by another process.
5. Check the port, targetport and nodeport are configured correctly in YAML file
