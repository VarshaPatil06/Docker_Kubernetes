Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.

-->
 A DaemonSet makes sure it creates one pod on each existing node.
while ReplicaSet is a Kubernetes resource that ensures its pods are always kept running. It doesnâ€™t guarantee that each node will have a pod; it only ensures the desired replica count.

Usecases:
1. monitoring resource utilization like CPU, memory, and other metrics on each node.
2.Ensures storage availability
