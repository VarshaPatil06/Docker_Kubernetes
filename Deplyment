Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.

Steps:
1.List your Deployments: kubectl get deploy
2.View running Pods: kubectl get pods
3.Check the current image version: kubectl describe pods <pod name>
4.Set zero downtime using fllowing command:
kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 0}}'
5.Use the set image command to update the image to version 2
kubectl set image deployments <deployment name> nodejs=<new image version>
6.Verify the status of new Pods: kubectl get pods
7.If there is an issue occurs we can roll back using following command
kubectl rollout undo deployment <old deployment name>
